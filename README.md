Appo the Fox is a time-travel adventure game where you play as a clever fox with a mysterious pocket watch that can control time itself.

Appo can speed up or rewind time to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles.

When the world freezes or rushes forward platforms shift, traps reset and obstacles react differently depending on how you twist time.
